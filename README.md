The objective of this task is to use the simple functions in Pandas to analyze the grocery sales dataset and then visualize it using Seaborn. Apart from deriving some summary metrics, we'll also frame some questions and find answers from the dataset by delving into it. This will be a very good practice for data analytics enthusiasts.
